This is a simple calculator made in python using the Qt6 Extention
this is not supposed to be anything fancy, its just a quick study on how python works and what i can do with it.

this was made roughly a month before it was uploaded here, so you dont get confused on why some other things are more fleshed out than this one.

hope you enjoy
